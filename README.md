# Vita Ve - Remastered
## A remaster from an old project "Vita Ve" by Mihail Kuzmanoski

### Description
This project is just a website made for the company Vita Ve. Altough, this is not their official website. The main purpose of this project was to practice my coding skils for web design.

Here I used a lot of technologies such like: HTML5, CSS3(including SASS/SCSS), Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and a lot online css tools.

On this website you can basically see everything about the company. It is written in Macedonian, because that's where the company is settled. It features a nice and simple style, with modern design. It has a wide variety of smooth animations.

### How to open the website?
The website is not hosted, so you have to download the floder with source code. Once you download the whole folder, you just have to open the `index.html` file with your browser and that's it!
